# Low-Level Design (LLD) in Java

This repository contains various Low-Level Design (LLD) projects and coding exercises that I am working on to enhance my understanding of object-oriented design principles, patterns, and coding practices. The code is written in Java and follows clean coding practices.

## Learning Goals
- Gain a deep understanding of common design patterns and their applications.
- Solve problems by implementing various design patterns and techniques.
- Develop a strong foundation in Low-Level Design through hands-on coding and iterative practice.

## Projects & Exercises
Each folder or file in this repository represents an individual project or exercise. Here's an overview of what youâ€™ll find:

### Design Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Implementations showcasing the use of the Strategy Pattern in different scenarios.
- **Observer Pattern**: Implementations of the Observer Pattern, focusing on decoupling and communication between objects.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Examples of using the Singleton Pattern to ensure a class has only one instance.

### Problem Solving & Projects
- **Parking Lot Design**: A project that demonstrates how to apply the Strategy Pattern to a parking lot system for handling different vehicle types (e.g., Bike, Car).
- **Library Management System**: An LLD exercise focused on building a library system using various design patterns.
- **And Many more...
