Develop a text editor application in Java that allows users to input text and apply
 different formatting styles (eg: uppercase, lowercase). Also there should be systems
  waiting for the text to be updated. Everytime a text is updated, the text editor
  should notify the observers. Also the text formatting operations should be
  encapsulated and execute them on the editor's text


  Using behavioural design pattern
  
Observer Design Pattern- when one system is observing other system or looking for change in other system that is 
observer design pattern


Command design pattern- for excecuting the editor text is through Command design pattern

Strategy Design Pattern- used for how formating will work here in this text editor
